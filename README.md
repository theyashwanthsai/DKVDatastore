# KVDatastore
Minimal distributed key-value datastore

This is a minimal key value store written in golang, uses concepts of distributed computing and raft consensus algorithm. Uses the hashicorp's raft library. 

*Note* this project is simply to gain more knowledge on the raft consensus algorithm.
